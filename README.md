## PayBar Prison


</div>

### Description

This will allow you to Use PayBars like AllAdvantage or Utopiad while not having them take up Desktop space. This will also allow you to use PerpetualNet for the AllAdvantage. Whenever you want to get rid of an irritating PayBar of Free Internet Bar for that matter then all you have to do is click on the cop. Next you move your mouse over the Bar you want to get rid of and then press 'J'. Voila. Done. This works for Altavista, and some other Free Web. This uses hwnd or the handle of the forms to allow you to do this.
 
### More Info
 
Open it. Click run. Compile.

Some pay bars still only put in a picturebox with the advertisement or whatever other part of the bar you capture. I have added code to get the parent but it still does this from time to time
